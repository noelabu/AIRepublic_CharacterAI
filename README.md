To run the Wizarding Hub locally, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noelabu/AIRepublic_CharacterAI.git

### API Key Configuration
To use the OpenAI API, you'll need an API key. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and create an API key. Store your key in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

### Running the Streamlit App
After setting up the API key, you can run the Streamlit app to interact with the tools.

```bash
